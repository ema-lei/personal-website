          <p>Hi there! I'm Ema Lei, a 19 year old sophmore at UW, and this is my website. The image to the left and the page icon are all drawings of my favorite pokemon, Piplup. I love penguins and loved piplup ever since I was in third grade and it never really changed.</p>
          <p>I enjoy making things, be it a little trinket, decorating a jar, or a coding project. One of my favorite aspects of creation is giving it my own personal flare. The font in this site is taken directly from a game thats followed me throughout my years growing up. There are little easter eggs in the pages too! </p>
          <p>(Hint: I heard the projects titles might get a little nervous if you <i class="shake">hover</i> around.)</p>

          <span class="title">Crafting</span> 
          <p class="hobbies-description">Its always so fun getting losing track of time making a new trinket. I love learning through hands on experiences and I'm pretty sure my enjoyment in crafting plays some hand in that. While artistry isn't my strongest suit, I still work to the best of my limits and that hasn't managed to stop the fun yet so lets see how it goes!</p>
        
          <span class="title">Gaming</span> 
          <p class="hobbies-description">I love gaming! It's a great way to spend time with friends even across distances or to provide a short reprieve when reality gets a little too hard to handle. A couple of my favorites are: Minecraft, Baldur's Gate 3, Onmyoji, Lethal Company (or similar genres), and Palworld. Minecraft is a funny one. I usually pick it up for two weeks and then drop it for a year, but it has always been a safe game to fall back to when my friends and I have enough time.</p>
          
          <span class="title">Biking</span> 
          <p class="hobbies-description">Without giving out too many perilous details, I would say my enjoyment in biking has a lot to do with the convienent... <i>shape</i> of my neighborhood. Since I's not on a road, I can bike as slow or fast as I want and even listen to music when my headphones are on transparency mode. It's a great activity to give my mind a rest and my body a task, perfect for sandwiching between long study periods.</p>
          
          <span class="title">Fashion</span> 
          <p class="hobbies-description">Using the extra bits of time college gave me, I started to play around with my closet and explore diverses styles in hopes of finding one I liked. Eventually I did, finding comfort in the protective layers of buisness casual outfits. I must say overhauling your wardrobe takes a <span class="redacted">[no clicky]</span> amount of time and a <span class="redacted">[i said no]</span> amount of money.</p>

        <article id="family" class="topic-article hidden">
          <p>One of my biggest blessings in life is definitely my family. At home there were eight of us:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Mom</li>
            <li>Dad</li>
            <li>Grandma (Mom's side)</li>
            <li>Grandpa (Mom's side too)</li>
            <li>Emily (older sister)</li>
            <li>Me</li>
            <li>Evan (younger brother)</li>
            <li>Elliot (youngest brother)</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Emily recently graduated and left to work down where her job is at so we're down to seven people. Technically I'm also gone but UW is thankfully an in-state college and only about 20 minutes away from my house so I can visit them almost every weekend!</p>
          <p>I am so very grateful for all my siblings. They're basically built in best friends who I can always count on to be there for me. </p>
