          <p>Hi there! I'm Ema Lei, a 19 year old sophmore at UW, and this is my website. The image to the left and the page icon are all drawings of my favorite pokemon, Piplup. I love penguins and loved piplup ever since I was in third grade and it never really changed.</p>
          <p>I enjoy making things, be it a little trinket, decorating a jar, or a coding project. One of my favorite aspects of creation is giving it my own personal flare. The font in this site is taken directly from a game thats followed me throughout my years growing up. There are little easter eggs in the pages too! </p>
          <p>(Hint: I heard the projects titles might get a little nervous if you <i class="shake">hover</i> around.)</p>

          <p>One of my biggest blessings in life is definitely my family. At home there were eight of us:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Mom</li>
            <li>Dad</li>
            <li>Grandma (Mom's side)</li>
            <li>Grandpa (Mom's side too)</li>
            <li>Emily (older sister)</li>
            <li>Me</li>
            <li>Evan (younger brother)</li>
            <li>Elliot (youngest brother)</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Emily recently graduated and left to work down where her job is at so we're down to seven people. Technically I'm also gone but UW is thankfully an in-state college and only about 20 minutes away from my house so I can visit them almost every weekend!</p>
          <p>I am so very grateful for all my siblings. They're basically built in best friends who I can always count on to be there for me. </p>
